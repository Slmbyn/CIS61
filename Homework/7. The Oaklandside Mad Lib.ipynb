    "## **Background Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1: What is a Mad Lib?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 1:** A Mad Lib is a word game that involves filling in the blanks of a pre-written story or paragraph with different types of words (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) without knowing the context of the story. The person providing the words inserts them in the blanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is often a humorous and nonsensical story because the player's choices of words may not fit well with the original context. Mad Libs are usually played for amusement and entertainment, and they can be a fun way to explore language and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:** What is an example of a Mad Lib?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 2:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Original Sentence: \"The Oaklandside is one of the best examples of local journalism in California, if not the country.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mad Lib with Blanks: \"The (Name of a Newspaper Publication) is (Number) of the best examples of local journalism in (State), if not the country.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Player Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name of a Newspaper Publication: East Bay Times\n",
    "- Number: five\n",
    "- State: Iowa \n",
    "\n",
    "Completed Mad Lib: \"The (East Bay Times) is (five) of the best examples of local journalism in (Iowa), if not the country.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Mad Lib from ONE of the Oaklandside articles listed above. The Mad Lib should control for user inappropriate user input. For example, if the prompt asks to provide the name of a state and the player types \"apple\", the program should inform the player that is not the name of a state and give them a chance to ask again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an excerpt from the one the articles. The excerpt should be one or two paragraphs. You need to have at least 5 player inputs and at least five iterations. The player inputs should be bolded in the final print statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1: Adding conditionals could make your life much easier.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2: String methods could be extraordinarily useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3: Reference the slides on Operators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 4: Use lists when appropriate.**"
